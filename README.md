### Project Overview 
---
This project is part of my Data Management course from the first semester of my Master's program in Data Analytics at Clark University. It involves designing a database that simulates Yelp's platform, which provides user reviews and ratings for local businesses and services. The project includes:

- Database and Table Creation: Developed tables to represent key entities in the Yelp database.
- Data Dictionary: Compiled a detailed description of all tables, including attribute names and characteristics.
- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): Visualized relationships between entities in the database.

I addressed several business questions to identify focus areas, determine relevant data, and provide insights and metrics essential for informed business decisions. I achieved this by writing efficient, readable SQL queries and then presenting my findings to communicate the results effectively.
