### Project Overview 
---
This project entails designing a database that simulates Yelp's platform, which provides user reviews and ratings for local businesses and services. The project includes:

- Database and Table Creation: Developed tables to represent key entities in the Yelp database.
- Data Dictionary: Compiled a detailed description of all tables, including attribute names and characteristics.
- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): Visualized relationships between entities in the database.

I addressed several business questions to identify focus areas, determine relevant data, and provide insights and metrics essential for informed business decisions. I achieved this by writing efficient, readable SQL queries and then presenting my findings to communicate the results effectively.

## Tools 
- PostgreSQL
- PgAdmin4
- Microsoft Excel
- Microsoft PowerPoint
- [Drawio](https://app.diagrams.net/)

## Limitations 
I encountered challenges with file encoding while loading data, as some files had different encodings than the default 'UTF8' encoding of pgAdmin4. To resolve this, I converted the files to the correct encoding by specifying the encoding parameter during the data import process.
